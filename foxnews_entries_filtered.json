Two Democratic senators are scrutinizing a federal judicial nominee over his membership in the Knights of Columbus, drawing a stern rebuke from the Catholic organization. Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, raised concerns about Omaha-based lawyer Brian Buescher's membership as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee's review of his nomination by President Trump to sit on the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, as first reported\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/senators-quiz-nominee-about-membership-of-extreme-knights-of-columbus-78683\">by the Catholic News Agency</a>. In a series of questions sent to Buescher, Hirono asked whether his membership in the Knights of Columbus would prevent him from hearing cases \u201cfairly and impartially\u201d and, if confirmed, whether he would end his membership in the Roman Catholic charitable organization. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions,\u201d Hirono said in the questionnaire. \u201cFor example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California\u2019s Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf\">In his response</a>, Buescher argued that the Knights of Columbus\u2019 official positions on issues do not represent every one of the group\u2019s members and said he would recuse himself from hearing cases where he saw a conflict of interest. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately two million members,\u201d Buescher wrote. \u201cIf confirmed, I will apply all provisions of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges regarding recusal and disqualification.\u201d Harris, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus\u00a0\u201can all-male society\u201d and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage when he joined. The California senator also referenced Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson\u2019s statement that abortion amounted to \u201cthe killing of the innocent on a massive scale\u201d\u00a0and asked Buescher if he agreed with the statement. Buescher responded that his involvement in the group consisted mostly of charitable work and community events at his local Catholic parish. He indicated he would abide by judicial precedent regarding abortion. The Knights of Columbus maintained that its positions reflect Catholic teachings, and suggested that the senators' scrutiny\u00a0amounts to criticism of the Catholic faith. Kathleen Blomquist, a spokesperson for the Knights of Columbus, blasted the questions by Hirono and Harris as a throwback to past anti-Catholic rhetoric. \u201cOur country\u2019s sad history of anti-Catholic bigotry contributed to the founding of the Knights of Columbus, and we are proud of the many Catholics who overcame this hurdle to contribute so greatly to our country,\u201d she told the CNA. Blomquist added: \u201cWe were extremely disappointed to see that one\u2019s commitment to Catholic principles through membership in the Knights of Columbus\u2014a charitable organization that adheres to and promotes Catholic teachings\u2014would be viewed as a disqualifier from public service in this day and age.\u201d The Knights of Columbus was founded in the U.S. in 1882 as a society for working-class and immigrant Catholics. It has since expanded to include charitable services, including war and disaster relief, and the promotion\u00a0of Catholic education. The group, however, has come under controversy for some of its official stances on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, as well as its political activity. This is not the first time that one of Trump's judicial nominees has faced questions tied to faith, either. In\u00a02017, federal judicial nominee Amy Barrett --\u00a0a professor at Notre Dame Law School and a devout Catholic -- was questioned by Democratic senators about how her faith would influence her decisions from the bench. Barrett was eventually confirmed as a circuit judge on\u00a0the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.", "authors": "Andrew O'Reilly", "title": "Dem senators challenge Trump judge pick over membership in group"}, "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/battle-of-the-billionaires-brewing-trump-could-meet-his-match-in-2020": {"content": "<source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/1470/828/billionaires-2.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><source media=\"(min-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/1862/1048/billionaires-2.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/640/320/1862/1048/billionaires-2.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1?ve=1&amp;tl=1\"/></source></source></picture></div><!-- --></div><p class=\"speakable\">Donald Trump is the richest president in U.S. history \u2013 but as he gears up for a re-election campaign, the real estate magnate could end up facing off against someone even wealthier. The budding 2020 field of potential challengers includes no fewer than four fellow billionaires. The wealthiest of the pack, by far, is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The media mogul and gun control advocate\u2019s net worth is estimated at nearly $52 billion, according to the latest Forbes 400 Richest Americans list. That dwarfs Trump, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $3.1 billion (though Trump has claimed his net worth is higher). Bloomberg may be the best-known of the billionaires eyeing a bid \u2013 and the most likely to take the plunge, given recent trips to early-voting states and a public switch back to the Democratic Party after years as an independent \u2013 but several others have stirred speculation. <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong> They include: Hedge fund-manager-turned-environmental-activist Tom Steyer (worth $1.6 billion, says Forbes); former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (worth $3.3 billion); and investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban (worth $3.9 billion). It\u2019s unclear if any of them would decide to run. While Cuban reportedly is flirting with a White House bid as a Republican or independent, the other three would be entering a sprawling Democratic field that includes high-profile senators and several former presidential candidates. At least on the Democratic side, their immense wealth could amount to a double-edged sword. Like Trump, they would have the ability to self-finance \u2013 which would help not only flood the airwaves with commercials but assert their political independence from special interests. Trump wouldn\u2019t be the only one who could claim he\u2019s not for sale with donors. \u201cWhat it can do is keep you in the race a lot longer than somebody who\u2019s not able to raise money and it obviously allows you to get your message out, whatever that is,\u201d said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist who served as senior aide on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. At the same time, their wealth could become a liability, as they seek the nomination in a party where all the energy is with the progressive wing. \u201cI think it\u2019s an uphill battle for a billionaire in the Democratic Party in a way that is distinct from the Republican Party,\u201d said Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily going to hurt them, but it\u2019s definitely not going to help them.\u201d Sroka noted the \u201cincome inequality\u201d issue will be front and center in the Democratic primary. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a cross to bear, but it\u2019s something that they\u2019re going to have to talk about and be forthright with throughout the primary process,\u201d he said. For now, Bloomberg is attracting the most attention among the billionaires. He took a highly visible swipe at the president over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-23/shutdown-stock-slump-and-mattis-exit-cap-grim-year-for-trump\">with a blistering column for his media company decrying</a> Trump's \"recklessly emotional and senselessly chaotic approach to the job.\" A former Republican turned independent who returned to the Democratic Party this year, Bloomberg made stops in the early caucus and primary voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this past fall, fueling speculation he\u2019s gearing up for a White House run. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of good in his post-mayoral life with his wealth and he\u2019s espoused a lot of progressive values as part of that,\u201d Elrod said of Bloomberg\u2019s efforts to battle gun violence and his vow to make climate change the defining issue in 2020. But she added that \u201cthe biggest thing that\u2019s going to hurt him more than his personal wealth is the fact that he used to be a Republican.\u201d She said that would be a \u201cfar bigger liability\u201d competing in \u201ca very left-leaning progressive grassroots primary.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-democratic-prospects-making-early-moves-in-iowa\">2020 DEM PROSPECTS MAKE EARLY MOVES IN IOWA</a></strong> Steyer, meanwhile, has attracted attention spending millions on a campaign to impeach the president. The former hedge fund manager \u2013 who\u2019s said he\u2019ll decide on a White House run early in the new year \u2013 kicked off a town hall tour this month in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote in the primary and caucus calendar. That tour will also bring him to New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada, other early-voting states. Steyer has also built up a vast email distribution list through his \u201cNeed to impeach\u201d drive and NextGenAmerica, the grassroots advocacy organization he created five years ago. \u201cWhen you think of Tom Steyer, the first thing Democratic voters think of is he\u2019s for impeachment, which is not a bad thing, because he\u2019s able to get his message out and break through,\u201d Elrod said. But she questioned whether the impeachment push would actually translate to primary votes. Schultz, who suffers from a lack of name recognition compared with some of the other uber-wealthy potential candidates, has hired a major public relations team and is expected to crisscross the country early in 2019 as he promotes a new book. For any of these businessmen who enter politics, strategists say the message will matter more than the money. \u201cYou can bring a lot of big money in, but we just saw in some of our recent elections here that that doesn\u2019t mean at the end of the day that you\u2019re going to be the one with your name on the ballot,\u201d Zandra Rice-Hawkins, executive director of the New Hampshire-based progressive group Granite State Progress, said. Ultimately, a hurdle for these candidates may be whether any of them can represent change in a party torn between the old and new guard, after rallying behind Clinton in 2016 only to see the establishment choice narrowly lose to Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the Democrats are necessarily interested in a candidate like [the billionaires] rather than somebody who is younger or who speaks to questions of diversity or who is going to run a much more unabashedly liberal or progressive campaign,\u201d Saint Anselm College politics professor Christopher Galdieri said.", "title": "Super-rich potential candidates all hinting at bids to topple Trump in 2020"}, "https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-calls-early-israel-election-for-april-in-bid-for-fourth-straight-term": {"content": "<span class=\"dateline\">JERUSALEM \u2013 </span>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday called early elections for April, setting the stage for a three-month campaign clouded by a series of corruption investigations against the long-serving Israeli leader. Riding high in the polls, Netanyahu appears all but certain to win a fourth consecutive term and a place in history as the country's longest-serving prime minister. Those bright prospects, however, could be derailed by a looming decision by the country's attorney general on whether to file charges against Netanyahu. Netanyahu, facing the possibility of bribery and breach of trust charges in three different cases, made scant mention of these investigations at a gathering of his Likud Party as he announced plans for what is expected to be an April 9 vote. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a> Appearing loose and confident, he listed his government's accomplishments in office and said he hoped his current religious, nationalistic coalition would be the \"core\" of Israel's next government as well. \"We will ask the voters for a clear mandate to continue leading the state of Israel our way,\" he said to applause from party members. Netanyahu, who also served a term in the late 1990s, has been prime minister for the past decade. His supporters point to a humming, high-tech economy, his handling of security issues, particularly countering the threat of Iranian influence in the region, and his gains on the diplomatic stage, including a close alliance with President Donald Trump that has paid important dividends. Pete Hegseth talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netahyahu. Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and his withdrawal from the international nuclear deal were both welcomed by Netanyahu. The Israeli leader also has quietly forged ties with Sunni Arab states, further sidelining the Palestinians, who have severed ties with the U.S. because they believe Trump is biased against them. The White House still has not released a long-awaited peace plan, and Monday's announcement could further delay its release. But critics say these gains have come at a deep price to Israel's democratic ideals. Netanyahu's hard-line government has promoted a series of laws that critics say are aimed at muzzling liberal critics and sidelining the minority Arab population. They point to wide gaps between rich and poor and high cost of living, and say that by neglecting the Palestinian issue and continuing to build settlements in the West Bank, the country is on the path to becoming an apartheid-like binational state. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak called the election \"the most fateful\" since the assassination of then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. \"If we all act properly, on April 10 we will part with Netanyahu,\" he said on Hahadashot TV. \"The state of Israel will get on a different path instead of this nationalist, racist, dark vision.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son temporarily blocked from Facebook after a post criticizing the social media platform for removing a post in which he called on Muslims to leave Israel. Barak called for the country's dovish and centrist parties to band together in a unified \"bloc\" in a bid to topple Likud. Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said the election was a battle for the \"soul of the country.\" For now, there does not appear to be anyone with the popularity or gravitas to topple Netanyahu. One wild card is Benny Gantz, a popular former military chief who is flirting with the idea of entering politics. Opposition parties have been aggressively courting Gantz. But for now, he has not committed to joining any party. Instead, the biggest threat appears to be posed by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who must soon decide on whether to indict the prime minister. Earlier this month, police recommended that Netanyahu be charged with bribery for promoting regulatory changes worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the country's main telecom company Bezeq. In exchange, they believe Netanyahu used his connections with Bezeq's controlling shareholder to receive positive press coverage on the company's popular news site. Police have also recommended indicting Netanyahu on corruption charges in two other cases. One involves accepting gifts from billionaire friends, and the second revolves around alleged offers of advantageous legislation for a major newspaper in return for favorable press coverage. Arrests come after two deadly shootings are blamed on the terror group; Trey Yingst report from the West Bank on the week of heavy violence. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and said he is the victim of a media-fueled witch hunt. At Monday's Likud meeting, Netanyahu brushed off a reporter's question and said he expected the investigations to lead nowhere. Mandelblit has not said when he expects to make a decision. The Justice Ministry announced Monday that deliberations were continuing and were \"not dependent on political events.\" Israeli law is unclear about whether a sitting prime minister must resign if charged with a crime, and Netanyahu has hinted that he will remain in office to fight any indictment. But criminal charges, and the distraction of a protracted legal battle, could fuel calls for him to step aside. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlan, a key ally, said Monday that a prime minister \"cannot serve\" if he is indicted following a required hearing. Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Israel's Hebrew University, said the campaign would be dominated by \"a discussion of whether Netanyahu should stay after, if he is prosecuted.\" He said Netanyahu had settled on the April election, roughly seven months ahead of schedule, in part to \"pre-empt\" an indictment. The thinking is that it would be politically difficult for Mandelblit to indict, and potentially topple, a popular, newly re-elected prime minister. \"He wants to turn around to the attorney general and say `before you decide to prosecute me pay attention. The people of Israel have re-elected me for a fourth time,\"' Hazan explained. An electoral victory would send a message that \"you cannot overturn the results of a democratic election,\" he said. Palestinian militant groups announce they've agreed to a cease-fire with Israel to stop the heaviest fighting between them in years; Benjamin Hall reports from Sderot, Israel. Netanyahu's coalition has been roiled by internal divisions for months. Avigdor Lieberman, leader of a small, ultranationalist party, resigned as defense minister last month to protest what he perceived to be the government's weak response to rocket attacks from Hamas-ruled Gaza. That left Netanyahu with a fragile majority of just 61 seats in the 120-seat parliament. But a new bill extending the military draft to Jewish ultra-Orthodox men appeared to be the final trigger for the government's downfall. Ultra-Orthodox parties consider conscription a taboo. As a deadline for the legislation loomed, his religious coalition partners were demanding the legislation be weakened. Earlier Monday, Lapid, a harsh critic of the religious parties, said he was rescinding his support for the draft bill, saying the planned compromise essentially rewarded draft dodgers. As a result, Netanyahu convened his fellow coalition faction leaders and the decision was made to dissolve parliament and go to elections.", "title": "Netanyahu calls early Israel election for April in bid for fourth straight term"}, "http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/12/24/dan-bongino-rips-bob-corker-over-really-gross-shot-president-donald-trump": {"content": "Dan Bongino slammed Tennessee Sen.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is also the budget director, said he was waiting to hear from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer about a counteroffer the White House presented Schumer over the weekend. Mulvaney would only say the offer was between Trump's $5.7 billion request and the $1.3 billion Democrats have offered. \"We moved off of the five and we hope they move up from their 1.3,\" Mulvaney said. A Democratic aide told the Associated Press that the offer from the White House on Saturday was $2.5 billion -- an initial $2.1 billion plus $400 million Democrats called a \"slush fund\" for the president's other immigration priorities. But Democrats complained Monday that it's unclear what Trump would actually accept. \u201c[D]ifferent people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment,\u201d House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement. \u201cThe president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.\u201d Senate negotiators are continuing talks behind the scenes with Democrats and Republicans.

It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed!\" The partial government closure affects hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country and is expected to last at least through Thursday, when the House and Senate meet again.

That means Wednesday is the first day the public could begin to feel the effects of lost government services, Mulvaney said. Funding for numerous departments and agencies expired Saturday. The disruption is affecting many operations and some 800,000 federal employees. Both the House and Senate have adjourned until later in the week. The president\u2019s border-security meeting Monday afternoon included Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other department officials, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. Senate negotiators continued talks behind the scenes with Democrats and Republicans. The House and Senate briefly gaveled into session on Christmas Eve before closing again with no further action. The White House insisted Trump will reject any deal that does not include money for a wall or fence; Democrats held firm in their opposition to a wall or other physical barrier. As Republicans prepare to relinquish their hold on government, with Democrats taking control of the House in January, the opportunities \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the GOP alliance with the Trump White House may be running their course. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-blocks-deportation-of-honduran-mother-without-daughter\"><strong>JUDGE BLOCKS DEPORTATION OF HONDURAN MOTHER WITHOUT HER DAUGHTER</strong></a> No sooner had Trump signaled he might be backing off his demand for $5 billion to build a border wall with Mexico \u2014 easing away from a partial government shutdown \u2014 than he took a U-turn after being scolded by conservative allies and pundits, who accused him of wavering on a campaign promise. \u201cTrump is plunging the country into chaos,\u201d the Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement on Christmas Eve. \u201cInstead of bringing certainty into people\u2019s lives, he\u2019s continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts.\u201d Trump told Republican leaders at the White House last week he wouldn\u2019t sign a Senate-passed compromise bill, which would have kept border security money at $1.3 billion. <em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em>", "authors": "Frank Miles", "title": "Trump brags about contract for wall in Texas, blames Dems for partial shutdown"}, "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-accused-of-religious-bigotry-for-questioning-trump-court-picks-knights-of-columbus-ties": {"content": " Following <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-and-hirono-question-federal-judicial-nominee-over-knights-of-columbus-membership\">questions from multiple Democratic senators</a> over the impartiality of Trump judicial nominee Brian Buescher and his ties to the Knights of Columbus, a charitable Roman Catholic organization, Republicans and various religious leaders hit back Monday against \u201creligious bigotry.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about the Knights of Columbus or Catholics, this is an ongoing attack from the extremist left of the Democratic Party to silence people of faith and run them out of engaging in public service based on their religious beliefs,\u201d Penny Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America, a Christian women\u2019s activist group, said in a written statement. \u201cIt is pure and simple religious bigotry,\u201d Nance added.  <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a> Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, recently raised concerns about Buescher's membership as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee's review of his nomination by President Trump to sit on the U.S. District Court in Nebraska. <a href=\"https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/senators-quiz-nominee-about-membership-of-extreme-knights-of-columbus-78683\">The Catholic News Agency (CNA)</a> first reported news of their concerns. In a series of questions sent to Buescher, Hirono asked whether his membership in the Knights of Columbus would prevent him from hearing cases \u201cfairly and impartially\u201d and, if confirmed, whether he would end his membership in the\u00a0organization. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions,\u201d Hirono said in the questionnaire. \u201cFor example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California\u2019s Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.\u201d Harris meantime, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus \u201can all-male society\u201d and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage when he joined. The California senator also referenced Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson\u2019s statement that abortion amounted to \u201cthe killing of the innocent on a massive scale\u201d and asked Buescher if he agreed with the statement. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately two million members,\u201d Buescher wrote in <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf\">reply to the queries</a>. \u201cIf confirmed, I will apply all provisions of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges regarding recusal and disqualification.\u201d Prominent Republicans and religious leaders backed Buescher in the face of the questions. \u201cHopefully, in the eyes of Democrats you are not disqualified to a be a judge because of your religious affiliations and beliefs,\u201d GOP South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1077260236786987008\">tweeted</a>. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus are a Catholic charitable organization who have genuinely held beliefs about marriage &amp; abortion.\u201d \u201cWill not tolerate disqualifying judicial nominees because of charitable works and personal religious opinions,\u201d Graham wrote in a follow-up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1077260488550039552\">tweet</a>. \"The Black Church is very concerned because we know that when elected leaders attack Catholic organizations like the Knights of Columbus for believing timeliness Christian principles, then all people of faith are at risk,\u201d Rev. Eugene F. Rivers III, a civil rights leader and the director of the Seymour Institute for Black Church and Policy Studies, said in a statement. \u201cThere is no place for a religious test like this in our country,\u201d he continued. \u201cOur constitution forbids it and elected leaders should know better than to try to impose it.\" This is the kind of thuggish behavior we expect from third\u00a0world dictators, not United States Senators. \"This is the kind of thuggish behavior we expect from third\u00a0world dictators, not United States Senators,\"\u00a0Ken Blackwell, a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, said in a statement. \"That this attack on Catholics comes from the party of John F. Kennedy, who was proudly a Knight of Columbus, is particularly shocking and egregious. There should be no religious test in America, and I call on my Democratic friends to end this tactic of engaging in religious discrimination to destroy people nominated for public office.\" \u201cAlarming questions from Senate Democrats, showing they are getting more and more comfortable with imposing religious tests on Federal judicial nominees,\u201d the office of Sen.

Kathleen Blomquist, a spokeswoman for the Knights of Columbus, blasted the questions by Hirono and Harris as a throwback to past anti-Catholic rhetoric. \u201cOur country\u2019s sad history of anti-Catholic bigotry contributed to the founding of the Knights of Columbus, and we are proud of the many Catholics who overcame this hurdle to contribute so greatly to our country,\u201d she told the CNA. Despite the pointed questions of the nominee and the implications of the interrogations, Knights of Columbus Senior Vice President Kevin Shinkle said the organization has valued the backing it's received. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus is grateful for the support of so many people who recognize our charitable efforts and understand that mainstream religious beliefs shouldn\u2019t disqualify anyone from serving their country,\u201d Shinkle said in a statement to Fox News. <i>Fox News\u2019 Andrew O\u2019Reilly contributed to this report.</i>", "authors": "Matt Richardson", "title": "Dems slammed for questioning Trump court pick\u2019s Knights of Columbus ties"}, "https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-gov-brown-orders-new-dna-testing-in-35-year-old-murders": {"content": "A California inmate charged in a decades-old murder case could get a second chance after Democratic Gov.
