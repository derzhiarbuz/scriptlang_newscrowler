Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield appeared to reignite his budding personal rivalry with ex-Browns head coach and current Cincinnati Bengals consultant Hue Jackson\u00a0on Sunday during Cleveland's\u00a026-18 win. In the fourth quarter, Mayfield connected with tight end David Njoku on a 66-yard catch and run that sealed the win, with Mayfield then taking three snaps out of the victory formation as the clock wound down. But after the big pass to Njoku, Mayfield was seen\u00a0running downfield\u00a0staring at Jackson. The rookie also appeared to backpedal in an effort to get a longer look at Jackson. Mayfield downplayed the incident when asked about it in the postgame press conference. \u201cNo, no idea what you are talking about,\u201d he said, according to <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2018/12/baker-mayfield-stares-down-hue-jackson-but-plays-it-coy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cleveland.com</a>. \u201cYeah.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a> Mayfield has expressed his displeasure with Jackson since the former Browns head coach was fired earlier in the season.

Two Democratic senators are scrutinizing a federal judicial nominee over his membership in the Knights of Columbus, drawing a stern rebuke from the Catholic organization. Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, raised concerns about Omaha-based lawyer Brian Buescher's membership as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee's review of his nomination by President Trump to sit on the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, as first reported\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/senators-quiz-nominee-about-membership-of-extreme-knights-of-columbus-78683\">by the Catholic News Agency</a>. In a series of questions sent to Buescher, Hirono asked whether his membership in the Knights of Columbus would prevent him from hearing cases \u201cfairly and impartially\u201d and, if confirmed, whether he would end his membership in the Roman Catholic charitable organization. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions,\u201d Hirono said in the questionnaire. \u201cFor example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California\u2019s Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf\">In his response</a>, Buescher argued that the Knights of Columbus\u2019 official positions on issues do not represent every one of the group\u2019s members and said he would recuse himself from hearing cases where he saw a conflict of interest. \u201cThe Knights of Columbus does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately two million members,\u201d Buescher wrote. \u201cIf confirmed, I will apply all provisions of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges regarding recusal and disqualification.\u201d Harris, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus\u00a0\u201can all-male society\u201d and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage when he joined. The California senator also referenced Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson\u2019s statement that abortion amounted to \u201cthe killing of the innocent on a massive scale\u201d\u00a0and asked Buescher if he agreed with the statement. Buescher responded that his involvement in the group consisted mostly of charitable work and community events at his local Catholic parish. He indicated he would abide by judicial precedent regarding abortion. The Knights of Columbus maintained that its positions reflect Catholic teachings, and suggested that the senators' scrutiny\u00a0amounts to criticism of the Catholic faith. Kathleen Blomquist, a spokesperson for the Knights of Columbus, blasted the questions by Hirono and Harris as a throwback to past anti-Catholic rhetoric. \u201cOur country\u2019s sad history of anti-Catholic bigotry contributed to the founding of the Knights of Columbus, and we are proud of the many Catholics who overcame this hurdle to contribute so greatly to our country,\u201d she told the CNA. Blomquist added: \u201cWe were extremely disappointed to see that one\u2019s commitment to Catholic principles through membership in the Knights of Columbus\u2014a charitable organization that adheres to and promotes Catholic teachings\u2014would be viewed as a disqualifier from public service in this day and age.\u201d The Knights of Columbus was founded in the U.S. in 1882 as a society for working-class and immigrant Catholics. It has since expanded to include charitable services, including war and disaster relief, and the promotion\u00a0of Catholic education. The group, however, has come under controversy for some of its official stances on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, as well as its political activity. This is not the first time that one of Trump's judicial nominees has faced questions tied to faith, either. In\u00a02017, federal judicial nominee Amy Barrett --\u00a0a professor at Notre Dame Law School and a devout Catholic -- was questioned by Democratic senators about how her faith would influence her decisions from the bench. Barrett was eventually confirmed as a circuit judge on\u00a0the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.", "authors": "Andrew O'Reilly", "title": "Dem senators challenge Trump judge pick over membership in group"}, "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/late-hit-on-chicago-bears-mitchell-trubisky-sparks-brawl-leads-to-ejections": {"content": "Sunday's game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Chicago Bears erupted into a brawl between the teams after a late hit on Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky by 49ers defensive back Marcell Harris.

Noorah had been a student in Portland since 2014 and had been receiving just over $1,800-a-month as a stipend from the Saudi government for living expenses, according to the newspaper. He is from Jeddah and was housed by a host mother. Noorah was jailed on $1 million bail after the deadly accident and, under Oregon law, a defendant must post at least 10 percent of the bail to be released. The consulate reportedly paid $100,000. He was then placed into the supervision of the Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office and returned to the Portland house where he had been living. He was allowed to continue going to classes at Portland Community College while his case proceeded but was initially placed under house arrest. On June 10, Noorah was allowed to study on campus after receiving permission from his release supervisor.

Smith was carted off the field. The year 2018 was magical for many athletes -- but some had to suffer through a gruesome injury that kept them out of a game or off the field for far longer. From broken legs to bloodied heads, here are some of the more memorable injuries over the last year. <strong>WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES BELOW</strong> <strong>ISAIAH CANAAN</strong> Phoenix Suns guard Isaiah Canaan suffered a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/graphic-video-suns-guard-isaiah-canaan-suffers-grisly-season-ending-ankle-injury\" target=\"_blank\">grisly ankle injury</a> in a Feb. 1 game against the Dallas Mavericks. While driving to the hoop, he got tangled up at the basket and landed awkwardly on his left ankle. Canaan\u2019s teammates and several of his opponents were immediately horrified\u00a0at Canaan\u2019s dangling ankle. Devin Booker buried his face in his warm-up shirt, while Wesley Matthews walked away with his hands over his eyes. The injury ended Canaan's 2017-18 season. <strong>TYRONE CRAWFORD</strong> Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford was taken <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dallas-cowboys-defensive-lineman-tyrone-crawford-carted-from-field-after-suffering-neck-injury\" target=\"_blank\">off the field Dec. 23</a> on a stretcher after she was injured during a play against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Crawford appeared to be injured after being hit in the neck by the shoulder of Buccaneers offensive lineman Ryan Jensen on the second play of the game. Crawford was released from the hospital hours after the injury. <strong>KRIS DUNN</strong> Chicago Bulls guard Kris Dunn <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/graphic-video-chicago-bulls-kris-dunn-shatters-teeth-in-face-first-fall\" target=\"_blank\">dislocated two teeth</a> and suffered a concussion after taking a scary fall from a dunk in a Jan. 17 game against the Golden State Warriors. With 2 minutes and 52 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Dunn stole the ball and broke toward the net. He dunked the ball but the momentum carried him and he was unable to correct himself during the fall. Dunn missed some time due to his concussion. <strong>TYLER EIFERT</strong> The Cincinnati Bengals lost tight end Tyler Eifert <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/cincinnati-bengals-tyler-eifert-suffers-gruesome-injury-in-game-season-in-jeopardy\" target=\"_blank\">for the season</a> on Sept. 30 after he suffered a gruesome lower right leg injury in the third quarter against the Atlanta Falcons. Eifert caught a pass from quarterback Andy Dalton and was immediately tackled by Falcons defenders De\u2019Vondre Campbell and Jack Crawford. Eifert\u2019s ankle appeared to snap back upon the tackle. The 28-year-old standout was down for several minutes before being carted off the field. His leg was stabilized by the medical staff as he was embraced by teammates on his way to the locker room. <strong>TYLER ENNIS</strong> Former NBA player Tyler Ennis was taken to the hospital after <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tyler-ennis-ex-nba-player-suffers-gruesome-ankle-injury-in-turkish-league-game\" target=\"_blank\">suffering a gruesome ankle</a> injury during a Turkish basketball league game on Oct. 21. Ennis, who is in his first season for Fenerbahce, was driving toward the basket in the first quarter when he collided with Malcolm Armstead, who plays for Buyukcekmece. Ennis was seen down on the floor in immense pain. <strong>TAIWAN JONES</strong> Buffalo Bills running back Taiwan Jones was left bloodied after a play during a game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sept. 16. Jones recovered a fumble in his team's own end zone and, while he was attempting to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/buffalo-bills-player-taiwan-jones-left-bloodied-after-gruesome-tackle\" target=\"_blank\">scramble away</a> from Chargers players, lost his helmet and was blasted head-on by Uchenna Nwosa. Jones laid on the field motionless for a bit before clutching his head in agony.

Levert was racing back to block a shot when his leg bent awkwardly upon landing. LeVert spent several minutes on the court attended by medical personnel while the crowd fell silent. Timberwolves players huddled in prayer while Nets players surrounded their injured teammate before he was taken off the court on a stretcher. <strong>TONY MCRAE</strong> Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Tony McRae was carted off the field <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/cincinnati-bengals-player-carted-off-field-after-taking-blow-to-head\" target=\"_blank\">after taking a blow</a> to his head in a game against the Cleveland Browns on Nov. 25. McRae suffered the injury in the third quarter when he attempted to defend a Browns player during a punt return. <strong>LIONEL MESSI</strong> Soccer superstar Lionel Messi broke his <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/lionel-messi-suffers-gruesome-injury-during-barcelona-match\" target=\"_blank\">right forearm while playing</a> for FC Barcelona in a match against Sevilla FC on Oct. 20. Messi was injured as he tried to reclaim the ball when he ran into the back of Sevilla midfielder Franco Vazquez and fell in the 17th minute. Trying to cushion his landing, Messi's right elbow bent badly. He was in visible pain and was treated by team doctors. They wrapped his elbow with bandages and the playmaker tried to continue, but he eventually left the field. <strong>MCKENZIE MILTON</strong> UCF quarterback McKenzie Milton <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ucf-star-quarterback-suffers-gruesome-knee-injury-during-game-undergoes-surgery\" target=\"_blank\">suffered a horrifying</a> injury against South Florida on Nov. 24. Milton was tackled at the end of a short run with just over 12 minutes to play in the first half. He was spotted grabbing his knee after the tackle and trainers rushed over quickly to attend to him.

Mostert was carrying the ball in the third quarter when he was tripped up on what appeared to be a routine play. Mostert appeared to try to brace himself with his right forearm. However, his arm appeared to twist the wrong way. On the video, you could hear the faint sound of Mostert\u2019s arm snapping. Mostert\u2019s teammates immediately call the training staff over to attend to Mostert, who appears to be writhing in pain. <strong>HARVEY PARK</strong> MMA fighters usually suffer tough injuries while in the cage, but Harvey Park <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mma-fighter-battles-through-bone-popping-injury-to-defeat-opponent-in-bout\" target=\"_blank\">suffered an especially gruesome</a> one during a fight at LFA 53 on Nov. 9.

Smith's right foot and ankle bent in an awkward direction as J.J. Watt and Kareem Jackson sacked him midway through the third quarter. Smith covered his face with both hands, then a towel as medical personnel check him out.

Trocheck went down with a right leg injury after he appeared to twist it awkwardly against the boards in the first period. His condition wasn\u2019t immediately clear. Trocheck appeared to go down in pain and couldn\u2019t put any weight on his leg. <strong>KELSEY WINGERT</strong> Atlanta Braves reporter Kelsey Wingert <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/braves-reporter-suffers-fractured-eye-socket-after-getting-hit-by-foul-ball\" target=\"_blank\">suffered a fractured eye socket</a> while she was covering a game between the Braves and the Philadelphia Phillies on April 1.

The budding 2020 field of potential challengers includes no fewer than four fellow billionaires. The wealthiest of the pack, by far, is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The media mogul and gun control advocate\u2019s net worth is estimated at nearly $52 billion, according to the latest Forbes 400 Richest Americans list. That dwarfs Trump, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $3.1 billion (though Trump has claimed his net worth is higher). Bloomberg may be the best-known of the billionaires eyeing a bid \u2013 and the most likely to take the plunge, given recent trips to early-voting states and a public switch back to the Democratic Party after years as an independent \u2013 but several others have stirred speculation. <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong> They include: Hedge fund-manager-turned-environmental-activist Tom Steyer (worth $1.6 billion, says Forbes); former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (worth $3.3 billion); and investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban (worth $3.9 billion). It\u2019s unclear if any of them would decide to run. While Cuban reportedly is flirting with a White House bid as a Republican or independent, the other three would be entering a sprawling Democratic field that includes high-profile senators and several former presidential candidates. At least on the Democratic side, their immense wealth could amount to a double-edged sword. Like Trump, they would have the ability to self-finance \u2013 which would help not only flood the airwaves with commercials but assert their political independence from special interests. Trump wouldn\u2019t be the only one who could claim he\u2019s not for sale with donors. \u201cWhat it can do is keep you in the race a lot longer than somebody who\u2019s not able to raise money and it obviously allows you to get your message out, whatever that is,\u201d said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist who served as senior aide on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. At the same time, their wealth could become a liability, as they seek the nomination in a party where all the energy is with the progressive wing. \u201cI think it\u2019s an uphill battle for a billionaire in the Democratic Party in a way that is distinct from the Republican Party,\u201d said Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily going to hurt them, but it\u2019s definitely not going to help them.\u201d Sroka noted the \u201cincome inequality\u201d issue will be front and center in the Democratic primary. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a cross to bear, but it\u2019s something that they\u2019re going to have to talk about and be forthright with throughout the primary process,\u201d he said. For now, Bloomberg is attracting the most attention among the billionaires. He took a highly visible swipe at the president over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-23/shutdown-stock-slump-and-mattis-exit-cap-grim-year-for-trump\">with a blistering column for his media company decrying</a> Trump's \"recklessly emotional and senselessly chaotic approach to the job.\" A former Republican turned independent who returned to the Democratic Party this year, Bloomberg made stops in the early caucus and primary voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this past fall, fueling speculation he\u2019s gearing up for a White House run. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of good in his post-mayoral life with his wealth and he\u2019s espoused a lot of progressive values as part of that,\u201d Elrod said of Bloomberg\u2019s efforts to battle gun violence and his vow to make climate change the defining issue in 2020. But she added that \u201cthe biggest thing that\u2019s going to hurt him more than his personal wealth is the fact that he used to be a Republican.\u201d She said that would be a \u201cfar bigger liability\u201d competing in \u201ca very left-leaning progressive grassroots primary.\u201d <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-democratic-prospects-making-early-moves-in-iowa\">2020 DEM PROSPECTS MAKE EARLY MOVES IN IOWA</a></strong> Steyer, meanwhile, has attracted attention spending millions on a campaign to impeach the president. The former hedge fund manager \u2013 who\u2019s said he\u2019ll decide on a White House run early in the new year \u2013 kicked off a town hall tour this month in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote in the primary and caucus calendar. That tour will also bring him to New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada, other early-voting states. Steyer has also built up a vast email distribution list through his \u201cNeed to impeach\u201d drive and NextGenAmerica, the grassroots advocacy organization he created five years ago. \u201cWhen you think of Tom Steyer, the first thing Democratic voters think of is he\u2019s for impeachment, which is not a bad thing, because he\u2019s able to get his message out and break through,\u201d Elrod said. But she questioned whether the impeachment push would actually translate to primary votes. Schultz, who suffers from a lack of name recognition compared with some of the other uber-wealthy potential candidates, has hired a major public relations team and is expected to crisscross the country early in 2019 as he promotes a new book. For any of these businessmen who enter politics, strategists say the message will matter more than the money. \u201cYou can bring a lot of big money in, but we just saw in some of our recent elections here that that doesn\u2019t mean at the end of the day that you\u2019re going to be the one with your name on the ballot,\u201d Zandra Rice-Hawkins, executive director of the New Hampshire-based progressive group Granite State Progress, said. Ultimately, a hurdle for these candidates may be whether any of them can represent change in a party torn between the old and new guard, after rallying behind Clinton in 2016 only to see the establishment choice narrowly lose to Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the Democrats are necessarily interested in a candidate like [the billionaires] rather than somebody who is younger or who speaks to questions of diversity or who is going to run a much more unabashedly liberal or progressive campaign,\u201d Saint Anselm College politics professor Christopher Galdieri said.", "title": "Super-rich potential candidates all hinting at bids to topple Trump in 2020"}, "https://www.foxnews.com/us/search-suspended-for-new-jersey-father-son-after-small-plane-crashes-on-trip-back-from-disney": {"content": "A search for a small plane carrying a father and son from New Jersey was suspended Sunday, three days after\u00a0the aircraft crashed off the Florida coast during a return trip from their\u00a0Disney vacation, officials said.

A Politico reporter in October overheard a person connected to the appeal request a copy of the special counsel\u2019s latest filing in the case from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals clerk\u2019s office. When the case was heard earlier this month, the courtroom reportedly was closed to the public and journalists were ordered to leave the floor where lawyers were presenting their positions. <strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong> There is scant information in the public docket about the case, but a three-judge D.C.

Riding high in the polls, Netanyahu appears all but certain to win a fourth consecutive term and a place in history as the country's longest-serving prime minister. Those bright prospects, however, could be derailed by a looming decision by the country's attorney general on whether to file charges against Netanyahu. Netanyahu, facing the possibility of bribery and breach of trust charges in three different cases, made scant mention of these investigations at a gathering of his Likud Party as he announced plans for what is expected to be an April 9 vote. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a> Appearing loose and confident, he listed his government's accomplishments in office and said he hoped his current religious, nationalistic coalition would be the \"core\" of Israel's next government as well. \"We will ask the voters for a clear mandate to continue leading the state of Israel our way,\" he said to applause from party members. Netanyahu, who also served a term in the late 1990s, has been prime minister for the past decade. His supporters point to a humming, high-tech economy, his handling of security issues, particularly countering the threat of Iranian influence in the region, and his gains on the diplomatic stage, including a close alliance with President Donald Trump that has paid important dividends. Pete Hegseth talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netahyahu. Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and his withdrawal from the international nuclear deal were both welcomed by Netanyahu. The Israeli leader also has quietly forged ties with Sunni Arab states, further sidelining the Palestinians, who have severed ties with the U.S. because they believe Trump is biased against them. The White House still has not released a long-awaited peace plan, and Monday's announcement could further delay its release. But critics say these gains have come at a deep price to Israel's democratic ideals. Netanyahu's hard-line government has promoted a series of laws that critics say are aimed at muzzling liberal critics and sidelining the minority Arab population. They point to wide gaps between rich and poor and high cost of living, and say that by neglecting the Palestinian issue and continuing to build settlements in the West Bank, the country is on the path to becoming an apartheid-like binational state. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak called the election \"the most fateful\" since the assassination of then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. \"If we all act properly, on April 10 we will part with Netanyahu,\" he said on Hahadashot TV. \"The state of Israel will get on a different path instead of this nationalist, racist, dark vision.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son temporarily blocked from Facebook after a post criticizing the social media platform for removing a post in which he called on Muslims to leave Israel. Barak called for the country's dovish and centrist parties to band together in a unified \"bloc\" in a bid to topple Likud. Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said the election was a battle for the \"soul of the country.\" For now, there does not appear to be anyone with the popularity or gravitas to topple Netanyahu. One wild card is Benny Gantz, a popular former military chief who is flirting with the idea of entering politics. Opposition parties have been aggressively courting Gantz. But for now, he has not committed to joining any party. Instead, the biggest threat appears to be posed by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who must soon decide on whether to indict the prime minister. Earlier this month, police recommended that Netanyahu be charged with bribery for promoting regulatory changes worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the country's main telecom company Bezeq. In exchange, they believe Netanyahu used his connections with Bezeq's controlling shareholder to receive positive press coverage on the company's popular news site. Police have also recommended indicting Netanyahu on corruption charges in two other cases. One involves accepting gifts from billionaire friends, and the second revolves around alleged offers of advantageous legislation for a major newspaper in return for favorable press coverage. Arrests come after two deadly shootings are blamed on the terror group; Trey Yingst report from the West Bank on the week of heavy violence. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and said he is the victim of a media-fueled witch hunt. At Monday's Likud meeting, Netanyahu brushed off a reporter's question and said he expected the investigations to lead nowhere. Mandelblit has not said when he expects to make a decision. The Justice Ministry announced Monday that deliberations were continuing and were \"not dependent on political events.\" Israeli law is unclear about whether a sitting prime minister must resign if charged with a crime, and Netanyahu has hinted that he will remain in office to fight any indictment. But criminal charges, and the distraction of a protracted legal battle, could fuel calls for him to step aside. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlan, a key ally, said Monday that a prime minister \"cannot serve\" if he is indicted following a required hearing. Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Israel's Hebrew University, said the campaign would be dominated by \"a discussion of whether Netanyahu should stay after, if he is prosecuted.\" He said Netanyahu had settled on the April election, roughly seven months ahead of schedule, in part to \"pre-empt\" an indictment. The thinking is that it would be politically difficult for Mandelblit to indict, and potentially topple, a popular, newly re-elected prime minister. \"He wants to turn around to the attorney general and say `before you decide to prosecute me pay attention. The people of Israel have re-elected me for a fourth time,\"' Hazan explained. An electoral victory would send a message that \"you cannot overturn the results of a democratic election,\" he said. Palestinian militant groups announce they've agreed to a cease-fire with Israel to stop the heaviest fighting between them in years; Benjamin Hall reports from Sderot, Israel. Netanyahu's coalition has been roiled by internal divisions for months. Avigdor Lieberman, leader of a small, ultranationalist party, resigned as defense minister last month to protest what he perceived to be the government's weak response to rocket attacks from Hamas-ruled Gaza. That left Netanyahu with a fragile majority of just 61 seats in the 120-seat parliament. But a new bill extending the military draft to Jewish ultra-Orthodox men appeared to be the final trigger for the government's downfall. Ultra-Orthodox parties consider conscription a taboo. As a deadline for the legislation loomed, his religious coalition partners were demanding the legislation be weakened. Earlier Monday, Lapid, a harsh critic of the religious parties, said he was rescinding his support for the draft bill, saying the planned compromise essentially rewarded draft dodgers. As a result, Netanyahu convened his fellow coalition faction leaders and the decision was made to dissolve parliament and go to elections.", "title": "Netanyahu calls early Israel election for April in bid for fourth straight term"}, "http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/12/24/paralyzed-army-veteran-gifted-mortgage-free-smart-home-christmas": {"content": "An Army veteran and Purple Heart recipient received a new home for Christmas that was built to accommodate his wartime injuries.

Francis celebrated a Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, opening a busy week for the pope that includes a Christmas Day message and blessing, a Dec. 26 prayer, New Year's Eve vespers and a Jan. 1 Mass. During his homily Monday, Francis lamented that many people find their life's meaning in possessions when the biblical story of Christ's birth emphasizes that God appeared to people who were poor when it came to earthly possessions, but faithful. \"Standing before the manger, we understand that the food of life is not material riches but love, not gluttony but charity, not ostentation but simplicity,\" Francis said, dressed in simple white vestments. \"An insatiable greed marks all human history, even today, when paradoxically a few dine luxuriantly while all too many go without the daily bread needed to survive,\" he said. Francis has focused on the world's poor and downtrodden, its refugees and marginalized, during his five-year papacy. The Catholic Church's first pope from Latin American instructed the Vatican to better care for the homeless around Rome, opening a barber shop, shower and medical clinic for them in the embracing colonnade of St. Peter's Square. To extend his outreach this Christmas, Francis sent his trusted secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, to Iraq to celebrate with the country's long-suffering Christians. Catholics are among the religious minorities targeted for Islamic State-inspired violence that has driven tens of thousands from their homes. Parolin met Monday in Baghdad with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. He is scheduled in the coming days to travel to northern Iraq to meet with Kurdish leaders in Irbil and to celebrate Mass in Qaraqosh in the Nineveh plains, near Mosul, according to the Vatican. The Vatican has for years expressed concern about the exodus of Christians from communities that have existed since the time of Jesus, and urged them to return when security conditions permit. Francis is likely to refer to the plight of Christians in Iraq and Syria during his Christmas Day \"Urbi et Orbi\" (To the city and the world) speech.

While both sides are trading offers to end the stalemate, they remain far apart, and a top White House official warned the shutdown could stretch into January. But there could be some movement. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is also the budget director, said he was waiting to hear from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer about a counteroffer the White House presented Schumer over the weekend. Mulvaney would only say the offer was between Trump's $5.7 billion request and the $1.3 billion Democrats have offered. \"We moved off of the five and we hope they move up from their 1.3,\" Mulvaney said. A Democratic aide told the Associated Press that the offer from the White House on Saturday was $2.5 billion -- an initial $2.1 billion plus $400 million Democrats called a \"slush fund\" for the president's other immigration priorities.

It was 200 years ago this Christmas Eve, on a cold and snowy night in the small Austrian town of Oberndorf bei Salzburg, inside the small St. Nicholas Catholic parish church, that the beloved Christmas carol \u201cStille Nacht - Silent Night\u201d debuted. The poem, penned two years earlier in 1816 by Josef Mohr, a 26-year-old priest, was set to music by 31-year-old Franz Gruber, a local teacher and the church\u2019s organist. According to legend, the organ was broken that Christmas, a leather bellow gnawed thru by a mouse. Desperate for music that could be sung without its usual accompaniment, the tune was composed for guitar. But because the guitar was not an approved ecclesial instrument at the time, the new song was performed by the two men after Midnight Mass. Mohr played the guitar and Gruber sang bass. The church\u2019s congregants sang the chorus. Music is often a mirror of the moment, and Mohr\u2019s lyrics reflected a longing for peace and serenity at a time when the nerves of its impoverished citizens were raw from the ravages of the Napoleonic Wars. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a> Yet the history of the world's third-best-selling single is a testament not only to warm seasonal sentiment and old-fashioned endurance \u2013 but to collaboration, cooperation and enterprise, hallmarks of most good endeavors that stand the test of time. The Mohr-Gruber partnership is well documented, and both men are deserving of credit for producing a piece so emotive and memorable that many, including President George H.W. Bush (and my own father), request it be sung to them on their deathbeds. Yet, in the spirit of Frank Capra\u2019s perennial classic\u00a0\"It\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\" the success (or failure) of one always impacts the trajectory and outcome of others. This is certainly so in the case of \"Silent Night.\" Josef Mohr, the man responsible for authoring the poem that became the world\u2019s most popular Christmas carol, was born out of wedlock, a scandal that threatened to stigmatize the youngster for life. It was Johann Nepomuk Hiernle, the local choir vicar in Salzburg, who overlooked the cultural prejudice, saw his talent and began financially and personally investing in the youngster, mentoring and supporting him throughout his childhood. In Hiernle, Mohr had found a champion who cheered him on. Aside from perhaps long-distant relatives, Andreas Peterlechner, a school teacher and Simon Dobler, a pastor in Hochburger, Austria, are names that history has all but forgotten. But it was Mssrs. Peterlechner and Dobler who first identified the musical gifts of Gruber. They nurtured his talent and encouraged him to study under Georg Hartdobler, a highly respected musician who taught the youngster to play the organ. But how does a single song, composed and sung by two seemingly obscure artists, first performed in a small church in Austria, somehow rise to enduring, world-wide fame? Enter Karl Mauracher, a repairman summoned to patch the hole in St. Nicolas\u2019 organ. Taken by the piece, he introduced the music to two friends, both of whom were members of Austrian folk singing families. The Rainers and the Strassers were equally enamored with the music and added the piece to their international shows. Audiences loved it. The Rainers first performed \"Silent Night\" in New York City in 1839. It\u2019s been sung every Christmas since. George Bailey\u2019s guardian angel, Clarence Odbody, was right when he said that one man\u2019s life touches so many others.\u00a0 Indeed, a single song, like almost anything else, is rarely a single act of genius, and its composition and distribution are dependent upon an anonymous army laboring behind the scenes. The bicentennial commemoration of Mohr\u2019s carol reminds us that behind the holiday\u2019s trappings and traditions, beyond the legends and lights and the songs, there rests a story behind the story, and never more so than at Christmas. The Incarnation, the Christian belief that God is the King who came quietly to earth in the form of a helpless baby on a silent night in Bethlehem, is the ultimate mystery and miracle by which even the years on the calendar are still measured. Millennia have come and gone and yet it still draws the Christian faithful to sing the same song first sung on a cold Christmas Eve 200 years ago.", "authors": "Paul J. Batura", "title": "Paul J.
